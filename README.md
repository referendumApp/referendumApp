# Getting Started

## Step 1: Install yarn package manager

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

## Step 2: Run the `ios_local_dev_setup.sh` script to install all the local development dependencies listed below:
 - Xcode CLI

 - Node v18
 - Expo CLI
 - EAS CLI
 - Ruby and ruby dependencies
 - CocoaPods


# Local Development

All the commands you need can be found in `package.json`.

If you need to debug Redux then make sure to install the [Redux DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) Chrome extension.
Once the Metro Dev Server is up and the code has been bundled you can press `Shift + m` in the terminal to open the Dev tools menu. Select `Open redux-devtools-expo-dev-plugin` to launch chrome with the Redux DevTools extension.

## Congratulations! :tada:
